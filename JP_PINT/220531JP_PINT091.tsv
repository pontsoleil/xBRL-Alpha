Unless codes for unit of measure are not in common daily use, implementers should as necessary provide a function for clarification of codes when invoices are visualised._Codes for unit of packaging from UNECE Recommendation No. 21 can be used in accordance with the descriptions in the ""Intro"" section of UN/ECE Recommendation 20, Revision 11 (2015):
The 2 character alphanumeric code values in UNECE Recommendation 21 shall be used. To avoid duplication with existing code values in UNECE Recommendation No. 20, each code value from UNECE Recommendation 21 shall be prefixed with an “X”, resulting in a 3 alphanumeric code when used as a unit of measure.__Source_https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/bis/#uom_"	____________UN/ECE__20___11_2015______________ _____________________________________________________________________UNECE__No.21___________UN / ECE__20___11_2015__________________________UNECE__21_2_____________________ UNECE__No.20____________________UNECE__21_____________X______________________3_____________	XST	4480	@unitCode	xsd:normalizedString	/Invoice/cac:InvoiceLine/cac:Price/cbc:BaseQuantity/@unitCode		UNECERec2	0..1				[ibr-88]-Unit code of price base quantity (ibt-15) MUST be same as invoiced quantity (ibt-13).
