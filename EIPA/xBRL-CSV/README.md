# xBRL-JSON and xBRL-CSV examples

This directory has the following example files:

* whyOrWhyNot.json - xBRL-JSON version of whyOrWhyNot.xml example
* whyOrWhyNot-metadata.json - xBRL-CSV metadata for example
* whyOrWhyNot.csv - xBRL-CSV data for example
* whyOrWhyNot-fromCSV.json - xBRL-JSON generated from xBRL-CSV 

`whyOrWhyNot-fromCSV.json` is the same as `whyOrWhyNot.json`, except for
different fact IDs.
